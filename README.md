This is a UWP application and had used for demoing purposes and showing how to use Windows.Storage APIs and how to deal with them

## UWP APIs had Used
Many Windows.Storage APIs are used here like:
* StorageFile
* StorageFolder
* OpenFilePicker
* SaveFilePicker
* MostRecentlyUsed
* FutureAccessList 
* LocalFolder
* KnownFolder (like: PicturesLibrary, SavedPictures, CameraRoll ...)

## Features
1. Creating, Updating or Deleting `.txt` files and reading of its properties like (name, description, date taken and size ...etc) and these files inside Local folder of the app.
2. Save a file with `.txt` format in specified location using SaveFilePicker.
3. Open folders and files with any format and read therir properties.
4. Dealing with MostRecentlyUsed and FutureAccessList and you can see the difference between them from [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/files/how-to-track-recently-used-files-and-folders)
5. Can this app get files (in most cases images) from Pictures folder directly, because it has the permissions to access to this folder and its subfolders like (CameraRoll, SavedPictures and Screenshots).
